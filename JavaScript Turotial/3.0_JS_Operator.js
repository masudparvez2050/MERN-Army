// Basic Arithmetic Operations
let x = 10;
let y = 5;
let z = (x + y) * y;

//JavaScript Assignment Operators

x = x + y;
x += y; // x = x + y
x *= y; // x = x * y
x /= y; // x = x / y
x %= y; // x = x % y
x **= y; // x = x ** y

console.log(4 ** 2);

// Adding Stirng and Numbers

let a = 5;
let b = "Hello";
let c = a + " " + b;

console.log(c); // Outputs: "56"
